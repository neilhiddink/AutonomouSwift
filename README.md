## üöò Getting Started

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/neilhiddink/AutonomouSwift/blob/master/Resources/pi-1.jpeg" width="250"></p>

This guide assumes you have already installed your Raspberry Pi in its case and have all of the required hardware and software. If you need more information about basic setup of the Raspberry Pi, a good resource is the official post [Setting up your Raspberry Pi](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/2) on raspberrypi.org.

#### Setting up the SD Card

1. Insert your MicroSD card into the MicroSD reader and then insert the reader into a USB to USB-C dongle so that you can plug it into your Macbook Pro.

2. Open Etcher. Select the **Raspbian Stretch for Desktop** .img file you downloaded from raspberrypi.org and the remote drive for the SD card, then click **Flash**.

3. Open Finder press eject to safely disconnect the SD card from your Macbook Pro. 

4. Insert the SD Card into the Raspberry Pi SD card slot.

#### üîå Configuring the Raspberry Pi

5. Plug in your Raspberry Pi. You should see a red LED light up near the power input:

6. After a few seconds, a green LED should light up next to the red LED:
