## üöò Getting Started

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/neilhiddink/AutonomouSwift/blob/master/Resources/getting-started-1.png" width="250"></p>

This guide assumes you have already installed your Raspberry Pi in its case and have all of the required hardware and software. If you need more information about setup, a good resource is the official post [Setting up your Raspberry Pi](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/2) on raspberrypi.org.

#### Setting up the SD Card

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/neilhiddink/AutonomouSwift/blob/master/Resources/getting-started-2.png" width="250"></p>

1. Insert your MicroSD card into the MicroSD reader and then insert the reader into a USB to USB-C dongle so that you can plug it into your Macbook Pro.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/neilhiddink/AutonomouSwift/blob/master/Resources/getting-started-3.png" width="350"></p>

2. The next step is similar to the instructions on [raspberrypi.org - Set up your SD card](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/3), except we will install Raspbian instead of NOOBS. Navigate to the [Raspbian downloads](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) page and download the image for **Raspbian Stretch with desktop**.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/neilhiddink/AutonomouSwift/blob/master/Resources/getting-started-4.png" width="250"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/neilhiddink/AutonomouSwift/blob/master/Resources/getting-started-5.png" width="350"></p>

3. Open Etcher. Select the **Raspbian Stretch for Desktop** .img file and the remote drive for your SD card, then click **Flash**.

4. Open Finder and press eject to safely disconnect the SD card from your Macbook Pro. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/neilhiddink/AutonomouSwift/blob/master/Resources/getting-started-6.png" width="250"></p>

5. Insert the SD Card into the Raspberry Pi SD card slot.

#### Configuring your Raspberry Pi

_‚ùóÔ∏è**Note**: We are not using an external monitor and keyboard to set up the pi and access the raspbian desktop. Instead, we will setup a "headless" connection to the pi, then access the desktop from the Macbook Pro with a free application called VNC Viewer._

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/neilhiddink/AutonomouSwift/blob/master/Resources/configure-pi-1.png" width="250"></p>

5. Plug in your Raspberry Pi. You should see a red LED light up near the power input.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/neilhiddink/AutonomouSwift/blob/master/Resources/configure-pi-2.png" width="250"></p>

6. After a few seconds, a green LED should light up next to the red LED.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/neilhiddink/AutonomouSwift/blob/master/Resources/configure-pi-3.png" width="350"></p>

7. Using your USB-C Hub and an ethernet cable, Connect your Raspberry Pi to your Macbook Pro.

8. On your Macbook Pro, open Terminal and execute the command:
```
  ping raspberrypi.local
```
This will start to display a series of ping messages every so often. Enter `Command + C` to end the ping, then write down the IP address in the message, i.e. the number following "...bytes from..." in the format 00.0.0.00.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/neilhiddink/AutonomouSwift/blob/master/Resources/configure-pi-4.png" width="450"></p>

_‚ùóÔ∏è**Note**: The IP Address you collected will change once we have accessed the desktop, because we will be setting up the raspberry pi's Wi-fi later._

9. Next, go back to terminal and connect to the pi via [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) with the command:
```
ssh pi@{YOUR_IP_ADDRESS}
```
When prompted for a password, enter the default: **raspberry**.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/neilhiddink/AutonomouSwift/blob/master/Resources/configure-pi-5.png" width="450"></p>

_‚ùóÔ∏è**Note**: Replace {YOUR_IP_ADDRESS} with the IP Address you wrote down in step 8. If your connection is successful, you should see `pi@raspberrypi:~ $` in the prompt._

10. The next step is to adjust the some of the pi's default settings. Run the command:
```
sudo raspi-config
```

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/neilhiddink/AutonomouSwift/blob/master/Resources/configure-pi-6.png" width="450"></p>

11. A settings page will appear inside of your Terminal window. You need to adjust a couple of settings here:
- Select **Change User Password** to protect your pi. The majority of people who use raspberry pi skip this step, so it is important! Keeping the default password gives anyone with your IP address an opportunity to access your pi.
- Navigate to **Network Options >> N2 Wi-fi**, then enter the [SSID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_(802.11_network)#Service_set_identifier_(SSID)) of your home Wi-fi (this is the name you assigned to the network when you set up your modem).
- Under **Boot Options**, select **Desktop / CLI** and the choose **B1 Console** option.
- Under **Interfacing Options**, select **P3 VNC** and enable VNC server.
- Under **Advanced Options**, select **A5 Resolution** and choose **DMT Mode 82 1920x1080 60Hz 16:9***.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/neilhiddink/AutonomouSwift/blob/master/Resources/configure-pi-7.png" width="450"></p>

12. With those items addressed, you need to select **Finish** and restart your pi when prompted.

_‚ùóÔ∏è**Note**: Optionally, you could SSH into your pi then run `sudo apt-get update` from the Terminal to ensure you have the latest update installed. This will require you to restart the pi again before continuing._

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/neilhiddink/AutonomouSwift/blob/master/Resources/configure-pi-8.png" width="450"></p>

13. Ok, now that you have the settings configured, it's time to access your pi's desktop with VNC Viewer. Open Terminal one more time and run `ping raspberrypi.local` to get the Wi-fi enabled IP address. With that, open VNC Viewer and enter the number in the search bar.

_‚ùóÔ∏è**Note**: If at first you don't succeed; try, try again. Make sure your raspberry pi is plugged in and the latest update to raspbian is installed. The time to complete this step will depend on your internet connection speed._
